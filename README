## compile & run the driver ##

to communicate with the device, a driver needs to be built and started, 
before you can download any tracks.


buid the driver with (kernel source headers must be installed):
$ cd serial_driver
$ make

load usbserial driver:
# modprobe usbserial

load navilock driver:
# insmod navilock.ko

plug in the device
-> dmesg output:
usb 3-2: navilock converter now attached to ttyUSB1
-> usbserial file:
# cat /proc/tty/driver/usbserial
0: module:navilock name:"navilock" vendor:1ee4 product:0001 num_ports:1 port:1 path:usb-0000:00:1d.2-2
1: module:navilock name:"navilock" vendor:1ee4 product:0001 num_ports:1 port:1 path:usb-0000:00:1d.2-2

two new devices under /dev should have been created. Most likely /dev/ttyUSB0 and /dev/ttyUSB1. 

unload the driver:
# rmmod navilock



## navilock reader ##

the navilock reader is used to read the tracks from the navilock device and stores them
on the harddisk.


compile navilock reader:
$ cd reader
$ make

if everything worked you should now be able to use navilock_reader.
type
$ ./navilock_reader
without any arguments to see the supported parameters. If you are not using any other 
usb serial devices, the device most likely is called /dev/ttyUSB1.
