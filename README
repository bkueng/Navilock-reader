The navilock reader is a command line tool to manage a Navilock NL-130BK
GPS Tracking device under linux. The main tasks are to store tracks
in gpx or text file format and deleting old tracks.


== kernel module ==

If you use kernel 2.6.31 or older you have to use version 1.0-x and use the included kernel module to be able to communicate with the device.

To see if the device is recogniced properly, plug it in and run dmesg. You should see something like this:
	cdc_acm 2-1.2:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
if so, the device is /dev/ttyACM0


== navilock reader ==

the navilock reader is used to read the tracks from the navilock device and stores them
on the harddisk.

compile navilock reader:
$ cd reader
$ make

if everything worked you should now be able to use navilock_reader.
type
$ ./navilock_reader
without any arguments to see the supported parameters. If you are not using any other 
usb serial devices, the device most likely is called /dev/ttyUSB1.

the script get_tracks can be used to get the newest tracks and save them to reader/tracks/



== firmware ==

the navilock reader was tested with the firmware
61718 - NL-130BK Firmware update V010


== miscellaneous ==

if you have any improvements or suggestions you are welcome to 
implement them and/or contact me
